				<p class="text">St Francis of Assisi Church is a Roman Catholic church in Sariaya, Quezon, Philippines. Based on the Historical marker of St. Francis of Assisi Church, the first structure was constructed in 1599. The second church was built in 1605 but was replaced by a third church in 1641. In 1703 the town was transferred to Lumangbayan but the earthquakes and floods of 1743 destroyed the church and the town caused the people to transfer to the present site. The present church was built in 1748[1] during the term of 2 Spanish Friars namely, Fr. Martin de Talavera and Fr. Joaquin Alapont.</p>

			<p class="text">The Sariaya Tourism Council (STC) is one of the most active, creative, resourceful and dynamic  organizations of its kind in Quezon province.  As mandated, it took, upon itself the role  of unearthing, discovering, researching, enhancing and promoting Sariayahin artistic, cultural and historical heritage as the cornerstone of its tourism program. Geography likewise is  big consideration in the institutionalization of the STC’s programs and activities, Sariaya being the only Mount Banahaw town in both Laguna and Quezon with a seacoast, along Tayabas Bay, and its promotional undertakings are highlighted via the so-called “KKK” or the “Kabundukan, Kapatagan, and Karagatan” elements.</p>
